## Estimating a psychometric function for breathiness perception
### João Pedro Hallack Sansão, M. N. Vieira, H. C. Yehia

The main objective of this work was to estimate a psychometric
function for vocal breathiness perception. For this purpose, an adaptive procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the psychometric functions, the QUEST method implemented by Palamedes toolbox.

In this method, a model is estimated after each psychophysical trial,
which serves to select the next stimulus to be presented. Two experiments were carried out, with different types of stimuli:

(a) pure tone with additive pink noise;
(b) synthetic voice with pink noise added to glottal source.

Data for calculating perceptual thresholds was obtained through
psychometric tests with alternative forced choice. Stimuli were
presented to the judges by headphones connected to a computer sound
card. Judge's basic task in each essay, after being presented to two
stimuli, was to define which one presented the lower noise level.

As levels were previously set by the method, it was possible to assess
the input correctness and calculate the next step. For each experiment, different signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio levels have been tested, since the psychometric functions are defined locally (i.e.: noise perceptual threshold levels may be different under different SNR levels). 

Thus, for each level a fixed reference stimulus was used in the comparisons and variable one was selected by the method. Presentation
order of each sample in the pair was random.

For the pure tone experiment, the sinusoid had a frequency of 220 Hz,
1.5 seconds long. SNR levels of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 dB were tested.

For the synthetic speech experiment, a 220 Hz glottic signal was generated and filtered by a vocal tract simulating the vowel /a/. The
noise was added in the pre-filtering phase. SNR levels were placed in
10, 20, 30 and 40 dB.

Three subject participated in each experiment.

For the pure tone experiment, breathiness perceptual threshold varied
between 0.8 ± 0.3 dB (for a 50 dB SNR level) and 1.9 ± 0.6 dB (for a
10 dB SNR level).

In the synthetic voice experiment, detected thresholds were 1.7±0.5
dB, 1.3±0.5 dB, 1.5±0.5 and 2.3±0.3 for SNR levels of 40, 30, 20
and 10 dB, respectively.

The experiments also determined parameters for each psychometric
function. 


## Phonological path in language development by twins: segmental, syllabic and phonotactics aspects
### Jéssica Caroline Souza Aguiar, Vanessa Cordeiro de Souza Mattos, Laís Rodrigues Silva Bockorni, Maria de Fátima de Almeida Baia

This paper aims at analyzing the phonological path in language development by one pair of twin girls, considering segmental, syllabic, and phonotactics aspects, in order to investigate the mismatch regarding the development of twins as pointed out by the literature (LEONARD et al., 1980; SMITH, 2011). For the discussion, we follow the Complex Adaptative Systems (CAS) (LARSEN-FREEMAN, 1997; BAIA, 2013), perspective which comprehends language development as gradual and emergent. Studies about twins’ linguistic development are still few, however there is already evidences of a mismatch in the linguistic development of twin children, generally due to the fact that one child tends to receive less directed speech, namely, input (SMITH, 2011). In addition, the literature also observes some tendencies in twins’ speech, such as i) they tend to complete sentences from each other; (ii) they tend to use less their own name and; iii) to have their own linguistic system (idioglossia/cryptophasia).
In this study, we analyze longitudinal data of Bg and Mg, aged 1-2 years old, dizygotic twins, in the process of development of Brazilian Portuguese spoken in Vitória da Conquista - BA. In the analysis, we investigated the phonological path of Bg and Mg and some differences were found as reported by the literature. For instance, whereas Bg realized in her first session the segments [i, u, ã, n, d], Mg presented only the vowel [u]. Nevertheless, the mismatch did not represent a significant delay in Mg development as at 2;0 years both of them presented the same vocalic system [i, e, ɛ, u, o, ɔ, a, ã, õ] and consonantal segments. In relation to the syllabic path, Bg presented V > CV > VV > CVV > CV(V)C and Mg, V > CV, VV > CVV. In general, Mg produced more V and CV whereas Bg attempted to produce different syllabic structures. Regarding the phonotactic development, Bg and Mg presented similar combinatory paths in some aspects, and different in others. Mg and Bg preferred vowels, bilabial stops and nasals combinations over their development. However, differently from Mg, Bg used dental segments in her initial phonological trajectory. 
In conclusion, we claim that there is, indeed, a mismatch in the phonological path of twins. Considering language as a complex adaptative system, and the fact that language development occurs based on stability and instability that affect the system itself and transform it constantly (THELEN; SMITH, 1994), this variability in the phonological path is expected, since each system is unique (BAIA, 2013).


## High back vowel weakening in word boundaries
### Amanda Fernandes Ivo, Matheus Freitas

This study is part of an undergraduate research project that aims at investigating the reduction of the highvowel [ʊ] between stop consonants at word boundaries in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) (e.g.: muit[ʊ]populosos). In a majority of languages, high vowels, such as [i] and [u], exhibit lower intrinsic duration than low vowels, such as [a], due to articulatory and aerodynamic factors.  Some works (LEITE, 2006; SOUZA, 2012; ASSIS, 2017) indicate that high vowels are reduced in BP. Assis (2017) shows that,at word boundaries, the non-stressed high front vowel [ɪ] is reduced, especially when it is between voiceless consonants. Thus, this study intends to investigate the vowel reduction for the non-stressed high back vowel [ʊ] at word boundaries. This work objective is to assess the vowel reduction as a variable and gradient phenomenon. The theory adopted in this study is the Exemplar Theory (JOHNSON, 1997; JOHNSON; MULLENIX, 1997; PIERREHUMBERT, 2001, 2003). According to the Exemplar Theory, we consider that phonetic detail, in this case vowel duration, has impact on the phonological representation. The methodology adopted in this study is based on the Laboratory Phonology paradigm (BROWMAN; GOLDSTEIN, 1990; BYBEE; CHAKRABORTI; JUNG; SCHEIBMAN, 1998), since we use empirical data to corroborate our analysis. To study the reduction of [ʊ], we used the recordings of 14 speakers (7 male, 7 female). The analysed data were recordedin the following seven Brazilian states: Maranhão, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. For the recordings, the speakers read the text O Brasilem 2012 (project: Sibilantes e róticos do PortuguêsBrasileiro, process: 484590/2013-8, CNPq). The data are composed by 199 words with a non-stressed final high back vowel [ʊ] following a word that starts with a stop consoant.The data were analysed through a speech analysis software, Praat (BOERSMA; WEENINK, 2018). We determined the production of a [ʊ] vowel and its duration. Results indicate that vowel reduction is both a variable and gradient phenomenon. The vowel was completely reduced in 21.6% of the occurrences. The reduction is favoured in the state of São Paulo. Vowel duration is lower in vowels following a voiceless stop than in vowels following a voiced stop. For future work, we intend to analyse vowel reduction of [ʊ] in more Brazilian regions and states.
